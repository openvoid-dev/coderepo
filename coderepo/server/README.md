# Code Repo Backend

This is the backend for the Code Repo project. It is built with Go and uses Fiber as the web framework with GORM as the ORM and Supabase as the database.

## Notes for development

Currently, models are built for testing purposes and will be changed in the future. The current models are: 

- User
- Product
- Order
  
After the testing, this models will be deleted, except for User, and will be replaced with the models for the Code Repo project.
